This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

**1 Loading and preprocessing the data**

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
str(activity)
```

**2 What is mean total number of steps taken per day?**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
totalSteps <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), FUN = "sum")
colnames(totalSteps) <- c("Date", "Steps")
hist(totalSteps$Steps, breaks = 20, xlab = "Steps taken per day", ylab = "Counts", ylim = c(0,20), main = "Histogram of steps taken per day")

# display the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
summary(totalSteps)

```


**3 What is the average daily activity pattern?**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# I need to remove NA in this aggregation otherwise everything is NA
meanSteps <- aggregate(na.omit(activity)$step, list(na.omit(activity)$interval), FUN = "mean")
colnames(meanSteps) <- c("Interval", "MeanSteps")
ggplot(meanSteps, aes(Interval, MeanSteps)) + geom_line()

# obain Interval that has maximum Steps value
meanSteps[meanSteps$MeanSteps == max(meanSteps$MeanSteps),]$Interval

```
- Interval 835 contains the maximum number of steps


**4 Imputing missing values**

Find out where the missing values are
```{r}
colSums(is.na(activity))
# all missing values are in the "steps" column
# impute the missing values by replacing each missing value with the mean step value of its particular time interval

# add 2 new columns to activity table, with the mean steps of each time interval
activity2 <- cbind(activity, meanSteps)

# use ifelse() to step through each row, replacing NA with mean step value of that particular time interval
activity2$steps <- ifelse(is.na(activity2$steps), activity2$MeanStep, activity2$steps)

# spot check if the operation is correct
#head(activity2)
#tail(activity2)
#activity2[activity2$date == "2012-11-29",]
# yes it seems correct
activityImputed <- activity2[, c(1:3)]

# calculate and plot total steps taken per day
totalStepsImp <- aggregate(activityImputed$steps, list(activityImputed$date), FUN = "sum")
colnames(totalStepsImp) <- c("Date", "Steps")
hist(totalStepsImp$Steps, breaks = 20, xlab = "Steps taken per day", ylab = "Counts", ylim = c(0,20), main = "Histogram of steps taken per day after imputation")

summary((totalStepsImp))
```
- The number of days when 10000 steps are taken increases a lot after imputation


**5 Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?**

```{r}
# add a new column with weekend/weekday annotation to each date
activityImputedWD <- activityImputed
activityImputedWD$wd <- ifelse(weekdays(activityImputedWD$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")

# spot check
# activityImputedWD[activityImputedWD$date == "2012-11-03", ]
# activityImputedWD[activityImputedWD$date == "2012-11-04", ]
# activityImputedWD[activityImputedWD$date == "2012-11-05", ]
# looks correct

meanStepsWD <- aggregate(activityImputedWD$steps, list(activityImputedWD$interval, activityImputedWD$wd), FUN = "mean")
colnames(meanStepsWD) <- c("Interval", "WD", "MeanSteps")

#library(reshape2)
#meanStepsWD2 <- dcast(meanStepsWD, Group.1~Group.2)
#colnames(meanStepsWD2)[1] <- "interval"

ggplot(meanStepsWD, aes(x=Interval, y=MeanSteps, color=WD)) + geom_line()

```
